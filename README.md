I want to solve user problems and make money.


## Friday 
- type out all queries myself 
- review code comments 

## Next 
- frontend for create collection
- frontend end for read collection 
- frontend for get collections  
- update collection 
- delete collection 
- user profile? 
- deploy 
- feedback 

## Review 
- should I add link previews to db when user adds them or when they save a collection? 
- should I use auth middleware?
