## Review 
- use Google/Auth.js user id for user id in db?
- synching Google data?
- separate sign in and sign up?
- previews or link previews 
- sign in query
- API code 
- should I add link previews to db when user adds them or when they save a collection? 
- should I use auth middleware? 
- favicon fallback? 
- file structure (eg putting types in app vs src)
- create separate types files? 
- var names in this project + link preview api 
- check lighthouse and security in dev tools 
- should I type session?
