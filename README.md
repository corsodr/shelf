Hard is good. Follow through. Use it. Get feedback. 

## Now 
- frontend for create collection 

## Friday 
- use session id instead of email 
- link google sub and db id? 
- use or delete middleware? 
- type out all queries myself 
- review code comments 

## Next 
- frontend end for read collection 
- frontend for get collections  
- update collection 
- delete collection 
- user profile? 
- deploy 
- feedback 

## Review  
- should I add link previews to db when user adds them or when they save a collection?
